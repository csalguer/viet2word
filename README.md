## **Overview**
viet2word is a revolutionary text-to-speech platform that leverages the power of Machine Learning Speech Recognition models to transcribe any Vietnamese audio into readable text. Built using React and TypeScript, our website utilizes cutting-edge techniques to push constrained datasets to new heights.

## **Key Features**

1. **Vietnamese Audio Transcription**: Our platform can accurately transcribe any Vietnamese audio file, including podcasts, interviews, lectures, and more.
2. **Machine Learning Speech Recognition Models**: We utilize state-of-the-art Machine Learning models trained on large-scale Vietnamese audio datasets to achieve high transcription accuracy.
3. **Constrained Dataset Techniques**: Our team has developed innovative techniques to leverage constrained datasets, allowing us to push the boundaries of what's possible with limited data.
4. **Real-time Transcription**: Users can upload their audio files and receive instant transcriptions, making it easy to access and analyze Vietnamese audio content.

## **Technical Details**

* Frontend: Built using React and TypeScript for a seamless user experience.
* Backend Sister Prject: Utilizes FastAPI for efficient API handling.
